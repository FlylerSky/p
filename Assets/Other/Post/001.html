<h3>Part 1: Introduce yourself </h3> 
<br>
Hello everyone,  
My name is Khánh. I’m a student in class 10/6 at Quảng Đông High School. I live in Điện Phong Commune, Điện Bàn Town, Quảng Nam Province. My family has four members: my father, my mother, my younger brother, and me. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and making videos to upload on YouTube. These hobbies help me relax and express my creativity.

<h3>Part 2: What benefits do you think you can get from sharing housework? </h3>
<br>
Sharing housework brings many benefits, not only for individuals but also for the entire family.  
First, it helps us develop essential life skills. For example, by doing simple tasks like cooking or cleaning, we can learn how to take care of ourselves and become more independent in the future.  
Second, sharing housework strengthens family bonds. When everyone contributes to household chores, it creates a sense of teamwork and togetherness. This helps family members understand and appreciate each other more.  
Third, it teaches us to take responsibility. By completing our tasks, we show that we are reliable and capable of managing our duties, which is an important quality in life.  
Moreover, doing housework can make us feel good about our contributions. When we help out, we know we are making a difference, and that brings us a sense of pride and happiness.  
Finally, sharing housework can reduce stress for parents. When children help out, parents have more time to relax or focus on other important tasks. This creates a more balanced and happy family environment.  

In conclusion, sharing housework benefits everyone in the family. It helps us grow as individuals and brings our family closer together. So, I think it’s a good habit that we should all practice regularly.
